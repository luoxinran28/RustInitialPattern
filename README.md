# RustInitialPattern

This project serves as a bootstrap template for starting new Rust projects. It provides a clean and minimal structure, including:

- A main binary (`src/main.rs`) demonstrating basic module usage
- A shared library module (`src/lib.rs`) for reusable code
- A utility module (`src/utils.rs`) for common functions
- An example additional binary (`src/bin/example.rs`)

## Purpose

The goal is to help you quickly set up a Rust project with best practices for organization and modularity. You can extend this template by adding more modules, binaries, or dependencies as needed.

## Usage

1. Clone or copy this repository
2. Run `cargo build` to compile
3. Run `cargo run` to execute the main binary
4. Add your own code to `src/lib.rs`, `src/utils.rs`, or create new modules

## Platform Compatibility

This template is designed to work cross-platform, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Feel free to use this as the starting point for your own Rust projects!
